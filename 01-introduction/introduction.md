# Introduction
Welcome! Together, let's learn how the *web* works and how to build our own webpages. Along the way, we'll be exposed to some basic computer science and software development principles.

First, what is the *web*?

## Basic web architecture
- Your **browser** (Chrome, Safari, etc.) displays web pages. It does so by acting as a client that sends requests via the Internet (HTTP) to...
- A **web server** (Node.js, Apache, etc.), which responds to the browser's request with a response containing the desired files. It can populate those files with data from...
- a **storage system**, aka **database**, (MongoDB, MySQL, etc.), which stores information like usernames, passwords, and pictures.

That's great, but...how do I get started? Here's the plan!

## What we will learn
- **Front end development**, which is the user-facing side (stuff you can see and interact with)
  - **HTML**, which defines the structure and content of your webpage
  - **CSS**, which adds visual styling to your HTML
  - **JavaScript**, which is a programming language that makes webpages interactive. We'll also learn **jQuery** which is an essential JavaScript library.
  - **Frameworks** like **Bootstrap** and **AngularJS** that make your life easier with prebuilt templates, components, etc.
- **Back end development**, which is the server and database. We have many technologies to choose from, so we'll pick these two:
  - **Node.js**, which is a server framework using JavaScript
  - **MongoDB**, which stores data
- Along the way, we'll learn the basics of how to use...
  - Google Chrome's **developer tools**, which helps you debug your work more easily
  - **Git**, which tracks your work in case of a rainy day
  - **GitHub**, which uploads your code to share with others
- We'll also touch on concepts like...
  - **Coding style**
  - **Responsiveness**
